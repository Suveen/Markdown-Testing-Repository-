##Testing Bold and Itallic Text:

It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com)

## Create Lists

Numbered lists format:

1. One
2. Two
3. Three

Bullet points:

* Start a line with a star
* Profit!

Other ways,

- Dashes 
- And if you have sub points, put two spaces before the dash or star:
  - Like this
  - And this
  

## Headers and Quotes

Sometimes it's useful to have different levels of headings to structure your documents. Start lines with a `#` to create headings. Multiple `##` in a row denote smaller heading sizes.

### This is a third-tier heading

You can use  one `#` all the way up to `######` **six** for different heading sizes.

If you'd like to quote someone, use the > character before the line:

> Don't believe every quote you see on the internet
 -- Abraham Lincoln 

##CODE 

There are many different ways to style code with GitHub's markdown. If you have inline code blocks, wrap them in backticks: `var example = true`.  If you've got a longer block of code, you can indent with four spaces:

    if (isAwesome){
      return true
    }

GitHub also supports something called code fencing, which allows for multiple lines without indentation:

```
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

And if you'd like to use syntax highlighting, include the language:

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```
